# Drive to Target EV

Hello! This is my attempt at making a accurate drive-to-target vehicle! The goal is to make the car accelerate and steer accurately to reach set waypoints and destinations within 1 cm accuracy over 10 meters. 

## 1 | June 16 | Project Setup!

+ Had the idea for a while, but finally started organizing my thoughts! I laid out goals and checkpoints for this project.
+ Started researching part sourcing(motors, wheels, axles)
+ Figured out how to use Github+GitKraken
+ Opened PR to add to submissions.

**Total time spent: 1.5h**
