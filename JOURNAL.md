# Drive to Target EV

Hello! This is my attempt at making a accurate drive-to-target vehicle! The goal is to make the car accelerate and steer accurately to reach set waypoints and destinations within 1 cm accuracy over 10 meters. 

## 1 | June 15 | Project Setup!

+ Had the idea for a while, but finally started organizing my thoughts! I laid out goals and checkpoints for this project.
+ Started researching part sourcing(motors, wheels, axles)
+ Figured out how to use Github+GitKraken
+ Opened PR to add to submissions.
+ Figured out constraints: 12v by 8AA Batteries only, must be under 80cm length and 30cm width, must be able to reach 10m in <5 seconds
+ Scouted two popular compatible motor sizes(25&37mm)
+ New dilemma: Separate encoder for accuracy? (edit - yes)

Starting CAD hopefully!

**Total time spent: 4h**

## 2 | June 16 | CAD work

+ finalized BOM
+ Finalized design plans(in my head unfortunately)
+ Started -> Finished! Axle and motor(front) assembly

+ Started code, skipping PCB because waste of money + this project will have multiple iterations


**Total time spent: 5.5h**
